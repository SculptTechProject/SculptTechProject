# Hey, I am Mateusz 👋

Backend engineer who enjoys mixing C#, Python and TypeScript to build reliable APIs, event-driven systems and tools that make developers faster.

I focus on practical engineering: clean domain logic, good testing discipline, and systems that are easy to deploy and monitor.

## 🔭 What I am currently building

### Sparkly – Build-in-public platform for developers
A platform for developers to track and publish progress on their projects.

- .NET 9 · ASP.NET Core · EF Core · PostgreSQL  
- Angular frontend  
- Auth, projects, updates, integration tests  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions  

Repo: [sparkly-server](https://github.com/SculptTechProject/sparkly-server)

Repo: [sparkly-web](https://github.com/SculptTechProject/sparkly-web)

### dummysensors – Synthetic sensor data generator (PyPI)
Tiny but powerful tool for generating synthetic sensor data for IoT and ML testing.

- Python API + CLI  
- JSONL / CSV outputs  
- Published on PyPI with Trusted Publishing  

Repo: [dummysensors](https://github.com/SculptTechProject/dummysensors)

### ServoSense (WIP) – Real-time sensor monitoring
A backend for live sensor readings, alerting and dashboarding.

- Django · DRF · Channels  
- Redis, WebSockets, JWT  
- Docker Compose development stack  

Repo: [ServoSense](https://github.com/SculptTechProject/Servo-Sens-App)
