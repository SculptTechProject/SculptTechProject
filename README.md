# 👋 Hey, I'm Mateusz!

💻 I'm a backend-focused developer passionate about building efficient and scalable applications – especially with C# (or fast MVP with Express.js 😉).

📱 I also build mobile apps using React Native to bring ideas to life on the go.

🏋️‍♂️ After coding, you’ll probably find me lifting weights or catching up on motorsport.

🎓 I'm currently studying Applied Computer Science at Bydgoszcz University of Science and Technology.

## 🛠️ Tech I work with:
- Backend: **Express.js**, **C# (.NET)**
- Frontend: **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**
- Databases: **MySQL**, **MongoDB**
- Mobile: **React Native (Expo)**
- Tools: **Docker**, **Socket.IO**, **Postman**,

### 🚀 Currently focused on Express.js REST APIs while also expanding my knowledge of C# and scalable backend design.
