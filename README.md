# 👋 Hey, I'm Mateusz!

💻 I'm a backend-focused developer with a strong interest in data engineering, scalable systems, and working in **C/C++** — building apps in **Python**, **Express.js**, and tackling **SQL** & **NoSQL** databases.

📊 Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into **data pipelines**, **ETL concepts**, and exploring tools like **Python**, **Docker**, and **PostgreSQL** to expand into the data world.

🏋️‍♂️ After coding, you’ll probably find me lifting weights or catching up on motorsport.

🎓 I'm currently studying Applied Computer Science at Bydgoszcz University of Science and Technology.

## 🛠️ Tech I work with:
- Backend: **Express.js**, **C**, **C++**, **Python**
- Databases: **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**
- Frontend: **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**
- Mobile: **React Native (Expo)**
- Tools: **Docker**, **Prisma**, **Socket.IO**

### 🚀 Currently learning more about Python-based data workflows, ETL design, and further C/C++ optimizations to move towards a Data Engineer role :)
